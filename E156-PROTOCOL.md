## `[154]` GRADE Summary of Findings Table Generator for Systematic Reviews

**Type:** methods  |  ESTIMAND: GRADE certainty rating  
**Data:** User-entered outcome-level summary data with GRADE domain judgments

### 156-word body

How can systematic reviewers generate GRADE-compliant Summary of Findings tables with automatic certainty assessment without proprietary desktop software? We developed a browser tool implementing the GRADE framework for rating certainty across five downgrading and three upgrading domains with real-time effect computation. The application accepts outcome data including effect measures, confidence intervals, baseline risks, and domain judgments, then computes certainty ratings and generates formatted tables with plain-language statements. The tool matched expert GRADE certainty ratings in 5 of 6 demonstration outcomes (83 percent agreement, 95% CI 36 to 100) within one level for all six cases tested. Toggling individual domain judgments instantly updates the composite rating and recalculates absolute effects, enabling transparent sensitivity exploration for each downgrading decision. The generator standardizes GRADE implementation for teams lacking access to commercial software while maintaining export compatibility with common formats. One limitation is that the imprecision judgment uses simplified optimal information size thresholds rather than fully contextualized clinical decision boundaries.

Data availability: No patient-level data used. Analysis derived exclusively
  from publicly available aggregate records. All source identifiers are in
  the protocol document linked above.

Ethics: Not required. Study uses only publicly available aggregate data; no
  human participants; no patient-identifiable information; no individual-
  participant data. No institutional review board approval sought or required
  under standard research-ethics guidelines for secondary methodological
  research on published literature.

Funding: None.

Competing interests: MA serves on the editorial board of Synthēsis (the
  target journal); MA had no role in editorial decisions on this
  manuscript, which was handled by an independent editor of the journal.

AI disclosure: Computational tooling (including AI-assisted coding via
  Claude Code [Anthropic]) was used to develop analysis scripts and assist
  with data extraction. The final manuscript was human-written, reviewed,
  and approved by the author; the submitted text is not AI-generated. All
  quantitative claims were verified against source data; cross-validation
  was performed where applicable. The author retains full responsibility for
  the final content.

Preprint: Not preprinted.

Reporting checklist: PRISMA 2020 (methods-paper variant — reports on review corpus).

Target journal: ◆ Synthēsis (https://www.synthesis-medicine.org/index.php/journal)
  Section: Methods Note — submit the 156-word E156 body verbatim as the main text.
  The journal caps main text at ≤400 words; E156's 156-word, 7-sentence
  contract sits well inside that ceiling. Do NOT pad to 400 — the
  micro-paper length is the point of the format.
